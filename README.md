# CoSpeciation


A two-patch, sexually reproducing individual-based model with nonoverlapping generations for investigating ecological and non-ecological factors of the speciation process.  

## Fitness function

$$
W_i = \frac{\lambda \psi(z_i, z_j)}{1 + \frac{C(z_i, z_j)}{K(z_i)}} (1-I_i)
$$

- The fitness of individual \(i\) is the product of its fertility \(\lambda\), reduction in fitness due to incompatibility of its parents \(I_i\), and its ability to find a mate \(\psi (z_i, z_j)\), divided by the amount of competition the individual experiences \(1+\frac{C(z_i, z_j)}{K(z_i)}\).
- For simplicity, we assume \(\lambda\) is equal for all individuals, hence the removal of the subscript.

## Incompatibility

\[
I_i = 1 - (1 - \phi)^{n_i}
\]

- The fitness effect due to the incompatibility of individual \(i\)â€™s parents (\(I_i\)) increases geometrically with the number of incompatible BDMI loci \(n_i\) between the parents by the factor \(1 - \phi\).
